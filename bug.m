In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` when dealing with objects. Improper management of these methods can lead to memory leaks or crashes.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *string = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
    self.myString = string;
    [string release]; // This is incorrect!
}
@end
```

Here, `string` is allocated and initialized. Then, it's assigned to `myString`.  Because `myString` is a strong property, it retains `string`. However, the line `[string release]` explicitly releases `string`, prematurely decreasing its retain count.  If the retain count reaches zero before `myString` is deallocated, this causes a crash. The correct way to handle this would be to avoid manually releasing `string` altogether, allowing the strong property to manage its lifecycle.
